# SeedGen
A poor attempt at understanding more about Minecraft seeds.

## About
SeedGen is a general purpose program that helps you with seed manipulation. 
It allows you to figure out seed of a string, bruteforce some strings from a seed, or bruteforce a string from another string

It has no exact use case, 
but it should work regardless of the version of Minecraft as long as it uses the `string.hashCode` function of Java.

Run the program with the additional argument `force` to allow bruteforcing string seeds up to 64 characters long.
E.g. `SeedGen.exe force`

Thanks for your time.
